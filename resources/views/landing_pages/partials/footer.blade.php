                    Estimated savings are calculated based on the credit profiles of all
                    loans originated as of December 01, 2017 in which the funds were
                    used for credit card refinancing. Bluebird calculates estimated
                    savings by deriving current credit card APR using minimum monthly
                    payment and 1% of the principal balance. We then compare estimated
                    credit card APR to Bluebird APR to determine median savings per
                    borrower. To evaluate savings on a loan you are considering, it is
                    important to compare your actual APR from your existing debt to the
                    APR offered by our company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loans used to fund education related expenses are subject to a 3
                    business day wait period between loan acceptance and funding in
                    accordance with federal law. While most of our borrowers opt for
                    automated recurring payment for ease of use, we also accept payments
                    by check or one time electronic payments. Borrowers have the
                    flexibility to choose the repayment method that works best for them.

                    The average 3-year loan on Bluebird will have an APR of 17% and 36
                    monthly payments of $31 per $1,000 borrowed. The average APR on
                    Bluebird is calculated based on 3-year rates offered in the last 1
                    month. You can find out more information from our agents.
